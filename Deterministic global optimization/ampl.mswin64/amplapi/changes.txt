  AMPL interpreter version.

0.2.2 - 2014-10-09

* [Breaking] ``AMPL.setData`` now has two overloads, ``setData(DataFrame)``
  and ``setData(DataFrame, String)``. These replace the method
  ``setData(DataFrame, bool)``.
  The code

  .. code:: java

    ampl.setData(dataFrame, false);

  should be replaced with

  .. code:: java

    ampl.setData(dataFrame);

  in the new version. Similarly, the code

  .. code:: java

    ampl.setData(dataFrame, true);

  should be replaced with

  .. code:: java

    ampl.setData(dataFrame, setName);

  where ``setName`` is the name of a set to receive the data from the key
  columns of the data frame. This allows providing data for multidimensional
  sets.

* [Breaking] ``Entity.getIndexingSets`` now returns an empty array instead of
  ``null`` for scalar parameters.

  .. code:: java

      // use ampl
    }

* Performance improvements in ``DataFrame.setMatrix``, ``Variable.fix`` and
  other methods
* Improved error reporting from ``Set.setValues``
* [Fix] ``ampl.display`` does not show an error if called on a non existent
  entity

* [Fix] Incorrect processing of indexed sets in indexing
* [Fix] ``Entity.getValues()`` throws a ``NumberFormatException`` when indexing
  set is empty
* [Fix] ``Objective.value()`` returns the old value after changing variable
  used in objective

0.1.0 - 2014-05-09

* Initial release
